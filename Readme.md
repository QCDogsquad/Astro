# Team 6871: Astro
  This is the source code for the Frist Robotics Competition Team 6871, QC Dogsquad. This source code was for our robot Astro, for the 2019 game season.
  
  All of the code is contained in two files _Main.java_ and _Robot.java_ these files are both located within the src/main/java/frc/robot directory. The _Main.java_ file contains a few lines that simply starts the begins the robot class, and is relatively unimportant. The _Robot.java_ file contains the Robot class that actually runs the robot and is heavily commented to explain what most of the code does.
